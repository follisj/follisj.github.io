                Something I’ve been curious about is if I could do a project from start to finish using AI. My goal was to use AI to get/provide data for the project, have AI analyze the data provided, and have the AI generate output for the project. The project I decided to try this with is one that I had been toying with since I started using ChatGPT – **Shakespeare and Steely Dan**.
            </p>

        <!-- Background Section -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-4 border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-3 pt-2">Background</h2>

            <p class="mb-4">
                For me, the summer of 1993 was the ‘Summer of Shakespeare and Steely Dan.’ I was an undergraduate, the spring semester wasn’t the best experience, and I needed something different. When I was looking at CDs I saw *A Decade of Steely Dan*. I wasn’t too familiar with Steely Dan at the time but I knew that I had heard them on the classic rock radio station. So I purchased the CD. I recognized a few songs, but heard the others for the first time. What surprised me most about the album were the discussions it provoked with friends.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                I’m not sure why I signed up for the Shakespeare class since I wasn’t really planning taking summer courses and had forgotten I signed up for it. It was then I remembered I had signed up for that class and the Shakespeare class. I also received some financial aid so I could pay for the classes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The thought of connecting the artists didn’t occur to me that summer, or the decades after. It wasn’t until I was trying to figure out what I could ask ChatGPT to do that the thought occurred to me circa February 2024. From time to time I’d try it again, and earlier this year decided to get different AI programs (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT) to map Shakespeare plays to Steely Dan albums, and even tried some text analysis to see if analytics agreed with AI output (it didn’t).

            <p class="mb-4">
                For this project I decided to use the following AI programs: **Claude 4.0, Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGPT 5, Perplexity, Grok, Mistral, Meta and Copilot**. Only the first seven Steely Dan studio albums (released between 1972 and 1980) and Shakespeare plays were used.
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold mb-2">The three areas I decided to look at were:</p>

                <li>Tracing the lineage from Shakespeare to Steely Dan;</li>
                <li>Which Shakespeare plays or soliloquies mapped to the top Steely Dan songs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4">Each program was given the following prompts:</p>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4 space-y-1 bg-blue-50 p-3 rounded-lg border border-blue-200 mt-3">
                <li>Map Shakespeare plays to the first 7 Steely Dan albums and provide the rationale for each one.</li>
                <li>Establish a linkage between Shakespeare and Steely Dan as follows: Shakespeare influenced A, who influenced B, …, who influenced x who influenced Steely Dan.</li>
                <li>Map the top 5 Steely Dan songs to Shakespeare plays and/or particular soliloquies.</li>

                Only **Hamlet** and **Macbeth** were named by all the AI programs, but not all to the same album. Hamlet was matched to five different albums, with four programs mapping it to *Pretzel Logic* and Macbeth was mapped to four different albums with four programs mapping it to *The Royal Scam*. The most common play/album matches were **The Tempest/*Aja***, with six programs mapping the play to album, and **Othello/*Katy Lied***, with five programs making the match. *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* was matched to *Can’t Buy a Thrill* by four programs. No other pairings were done more than twice.

                The album *Countdown to Ecstasy* was mapped to seven different plays (3 comedies, 4 tragedies). Below are the reasons each program associated the play/album:

                I didn’t know what to expect for what the AI programs would come up with for the lineage from Shakespeare to Steely Dan. One influence I thought all programs would list was **William S. Burroughs** since Steely Dan took their name from his novel *Naked Lunch*. But that was not the case, as only five of the eight programs mentioned Burroughs.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Excluding the six lineages provided by ChatGPT, the average number of intermediaries connecting the two artists was four. Among the seven non-ChatGPT programs, **Burroughs** and **T.S. Eliot** were the most common influences, each mentioned by four of them. The shortest lineage provided by ChatGPT went from **Shakespeare to Duke Ellington to Steely Dan**.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other notable influences mentioned by more than one program include **John Donne, Oscar Wilde, Vladimir Nabokov, James Joyce, Bob Dylan** and **Tom Lehrer**. The most out of place influence was given by Meta, which listed **Jay McInerney**, whose connection to Donald Fagen came in the 1980’s.

                    <li>**Existential Themes:** exploration of deep philosophical questions about identity, meaning and human nature.</li>
                    <li>**Moral Complexity:** morally ambiguous characters and situations without clear heroes and villains.</li>
                    <li>**Sophisticated Wordplay:** both use clever, layered language that rewards careful attention.</li>
                    <li>**Urban Cynicism vs. Timeless Themes:** Steely Dan’s modern, cynical perspective is seen as updating Shakespeare’s timeless concerns about power, love, betrayal, and mortality.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mt-3 text-sm italic">ChatGPT summarized the results as: “these pairings highlight Steely Dan’s affinity with Shakespeare’s existential crises, tragic ambition, ironic detachment, and bittersweet reflections on time and love.”</p>

                As far as I know there hasn’t been anything done (or that AI programs could find) connecting Shakespeare with Steely Dan, so this relied on AI to make the connections. What was interesting was that the responses from all the programs did show some agreement but also showed variability when matching albums/songs to plays/soliloquies. The programs also provided different paths for the lineage from Shakespeare to Steely Dan. I found the results interesting but would still like to do a deeper dive into the results and come up with my own lists.

                If I could go back to the summer of 1993 this might have been a good project for the Shakespeare course (I think the professor would’ve found it interesting). But I would only do it if I could use AI to help with the research process and a music streaming service for quick access to the Steely Dan library. The advances in technology over the past three decades make projects like this more feasible.
